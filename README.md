# xadrez-de-bruxo
Projeto para o desenvolvimento um tabuleiro de xadrex controlado por voz.

###1. What does it do?

This project is about an android's application that plays chess(machine vs. machine, machine vs. human, or human vs. human) by recognizing your voice commands. Here, there are instructions to build that android app and, also, to build a automatized chess board that can move the pieces by itself. To use your smartphone as a microphone under the table, is a funny way to play. :)

###2. How to install it?

For now, the project is being built, so it is unabe to use it or test it yet.
The release schedules can be found here: #todo

###3. How do I get involved?

If you need any help or more information about this project, I will be glad to talk about it, just send me an email (italogsfernandes@gmail.com).

###4. How to set up the dev environment?

There are three versions, in one of them the Mit AppInventor is the main plataform, which has less features than the others but is much more easier to use and understand. There will be a future version that uses Unity3D, as the main version and all the features will be there, the learning curve is harder but it worth the effort. The forecast for the complete app using Unity3D are fur&ther than for the App using the Mit AppInventor.

###5. How to ship a change?

If you want to colaborate constantly please send me an email and we will see the best thing to be done. But if you just want to make it without too much commitment and beadledom, just take a look at the weekly schedules (at http://scrumblr.ca/xadrez-de-bruxo), or the schedule for all the project, and choose something - your aid will be helpfull and your name will be paper as a github collaborator.
